AWS Docker CI/CD Cloud Project

Overview

This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying Dockerized applications on AWS using Terraform for infrastructure automation. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure efficient and consistent software delivery.

Technologies Used

AWS (ECS, ECR, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, IAM, S3, etc.)

Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

Docker (Containerization)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)

PowerShell (Scripting)

VS Code (Development environment)

Architecture

The project follows a three-tier architecture, including:

Frontend: A containerized web application hosted on AWS ECS.

Backend: API services deployed as Docker containers.

Database: AWS RDS or DynamoDB (based on requirements).

Features

Automated Deployment: Uses GitHub Actions to trigger deployments upon code push.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure.

Dockerized Applications: Ensures portability and scalability.

Security Best Practices: Implements IAM roles, encrypted storage, and least privilege access.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

AWS Account

Terraform installed (Download)

Docker installed (Download)

GitHub repository set up with secrets for AWS credentials

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-docker-ci-cd.git
cd aws-docker-ci-cd

Initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Plan the infrastructure:

terraform plan

Apply Terraform to create resources:

terraform apply --auto-approve

Push Docker image to AWS ECR:

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build -t my-app .
docker tag my-app:latest <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest

Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow:

Push a commit to the main branch to start the CI/CD pipeline.

Deployment

Once Terraform and GitHub Actions are set up, every push to the main branch will:

Build the Docker image

Push it to AWS ECR

Deploy to AWS ECS

Cleanup

To delete all infrastructure:

terraform destroy --auto-approve

Future Enhancements

Add monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.

Implement Blue/Green deployment using AWS CodeDeploy.

Enable multi-region deployment for high availability.
